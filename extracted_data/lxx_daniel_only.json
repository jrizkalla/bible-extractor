          "5" : "at what hour you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and lute, and every kind of music, you shall fall down and worship the golden image which king Nabuchodonosor has set up.",

          "28" : "Now when the battle was done, returning again with joy, they knew that Nicanor lay dead in his harness.",
          "29" : "Then they made a great shout and a noise, praising the Almighty in their own language.",
          "30" : "And Judas, who was ever the chief defender of the citizens both in body and mind, and who continued his love toward his countrymen all his life, commanded to strike off Nicanor's head, and his hand with his shoulder, and bring them to Jerusalem.",
          "31" : "So when he was there, and called them of his nation together, and set the priests before the altar, he sent for them that were of the tower,",
          "32" : "And showed them vile Nicanor's head, and the hand of that blasphemer, which with proud brags he had stretched out against the holy temple of the Almighty.",
          "33" : "And when he had cut out the tongue of that ungodly Nicanor, he commanded that they should give it by pieces to the fowls, and hang up the reward of his madness before the temple.",
          "34" : "So every man praised toward the heaven the glorious Lord, saying, Blessed be he that has kept his own place undefiled.",
          "35" : "He hanged also Nicanor's head upon the tower, an evident and manifest sign to all of the help of the Lord.",
          "36" : "And they ordained all with a common decree in no case to let that day pass without solemnity, but to celebrate the thirties day of the twelfth month, which in the Syrian tongue is called Adar, the day before Mardocheus' day.",
          "37" : "Thus went it with Nicanor: and from that time forth the Hebrews had the city in their power. And here will I make an end.",
          "38" : "And if I have done well, and as is fitting the story, it is that which I desired: but if slenderly and meanly, it is that which I could attain to.",
          "39" : "For as it is hurtful to drink wine or water alone; and as wine mingled with water is pleasant, and delights the taste: even so speech finely framed delights the ears of them that read the story. And here shall be an end."
